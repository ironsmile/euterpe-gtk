		<p>
			Mobile and desktop player for the self-hosted Euterpe streaming
			server. You need an access to an Euterpe server running somewhere in
			order for this program to be useful. You could try it out with the
			demo Euterpe server, accessible at the project's website.
		</p>
		<p>
			These are some of the things which this player supports:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Extremely light resource usage and fast. Excellent for constrained
				mobile devices such as phones and laptops.
			</li>
			<li>
				Accessing Euterpe server with or without authentication.
			</li>
			<li>
				Playing albums or a single tracks.
			</li>
			<li>
				Searching the database for music.
			</li>
			<li>
				Browsing by albums and artists based on their tag metadata.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mobile first but convergent. It works on both mobile and desktop Linux.
			</li>
		</ul>

					This version comes with a huge pile of improvements,
					bugfixes and new features. I will list the most notable.

						the search results.
					</li>

						staring. Including the progress of the currently playing
						track.

						of the window. On mobile it is accessible on a full screen.
