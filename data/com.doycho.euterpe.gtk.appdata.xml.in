		<release version="0.8.0" date="2025-09-09">
			<description>
				<p>
					This version comes with few new features and some bug fixes.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Browsing is enhanced with the ability to order by the browsed
						items in different ways. A quick buttons for going to the first
						or last page are added too.
					</li>
					<li>
						It is now possible to browse the songs directly.
					</li>
					<li>
						Songs' bitrate is now displayed on their widgets.
					</li>
					<li>
						The player's state is now saved better on shutdown, restart or
						any different kind of request through the desktop environment
						such as logging out. Previously it was possible for the player
						to exit without saving its state. So the current playlist, play
						position and window position could've been lost. This should no
						longer be the case.
					</li>
					<li>
						The play could now manage playlists stored on the server. The only
						notable missing feature here is that songs in a playlist cannot
						be reordered yet. Once I figure the GTK's drag-and-drop APIs this
						will be improved.
					</li>
				</ul>

		<release version="0.2.0" date="2021-11-25">
			<description>
				<p>
					This version comes with a huge pile of improvements,
					bugfixes and new features. I will list the most notable.

						Switched to libsoup from libcurl. This makes seeking and
						recovering from network changes rock solid.

						for an artist or all tracks for an album. Accessible from
						the search results.
					</li>
